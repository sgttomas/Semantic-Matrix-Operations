EVALUATIVE Chirality Framework  Evaluation Systems v1.1

(Grounding Context: The Chirality Framework is a meta-ontological, system-agnostic methodology unifying human-in-the-loop, semantic constraint mapping with iterative, relational expansions—enabling self-generating, self-referential solution spaces across diverse domains, while preserving conceptual coherence through reflection and validation. It comprises “semantic components” (arrays, matrices, tensors) that function as ontologies for reliable knowledge production, following a logical sequence: problem → requirements → specifications → output → verification → validation → evaluation → assessment → implementation → instantiation → reflection → resolution. Each component aligns with these phases: [A],[B] for problem statement, [C] for requirements, [D] for specifications, [X] for verification, [Z] for validation, [E] for evaluation, [Q],[M] for assessment, [L] for implementation, [W] for instantiation, [U] for reflection, and [N] for resolution. Removing any component or its meta-ontology destabilizes the framework’s coherence.)

1) CATEGORIES AND WEIGHTS
	1.	Coherence – 50%
	2.	Relevance – 20%

3) SCORING RUBRIC

COHERENCE (50%)

Score	Descriptor
1	Disjointed or contradictory references; major breakdowns in the meta-ontological flow.
3	Partially aligned structure; repeated inconsistencies, unclear mapping among components.
5	Mostly consistent with minor gaps; the overall sequence (A,B→C→…→N) is visible but not seamless.
7	Well-organized, minimal overlaps or contradictions; terms and steps fit the CF’s logic cleanly.
10	Exceptionally integrated; every matrix/tensor aligns, showing a seamless flow from problem → requirements → … → resolution.

RELEVANCE (20%)

Score	Descriptor
1	Purely abstract or off-target; fails to address domain needs or the CF’s knowledge-generation phases.
3	Minimal link to real problems or stakeholder goals; major re-interpretation needed for actual utility.
5	Moderately relevant; some clear tie to real usage in the CF pipeline, needs moderate adaptation.
7	Strongly tied to domain specifics; easily mapped onto the CF’s sequence for real tasks or solutions.
10	Fully embedded in stakeholder and domain contexts; evidently actionable in every CF step.

COMPLETENESS (20%)

Score	Descriptor
1	Major CF components missing or heavily under-explored (C, D, X, etc.).
3	Some tasks or phases in the CF pipeline are partially covered, leaving significant gaps.
5	Most CF phases appear, but details for certain steps are thin or incomplete.
7	Substantial coverage of the CF stages; only minor omissions remain.
10	Exhaustive detail, covering every CF stage and subtask with no overlooked aspects.

ADAPTABILITY (10%)

Score	Descriptor
1	Rigid, no mention of handling new domain data or iterative expansions that CF requires for reflection.
3	Slight references to flexibility; major rework needed to shift to new domains or solution spaces.
5	Moderate capacity for domain reorientation; some mention of iterative expansions or practical constraints.
7	Flexible approach aligned with CF’s iterative expansions; few obstacles to re-use in new contexts.
10	Highly reconfigurable solution space mapping; seamlessly adapts to new data or reflection loops at all CF steps.

End of Evaluation System

I will now provide you the set of instructions for implementing the Chirality Framework.  Because CF exhibits self-reference, iterative recursion, and meta-ontological properties, CF can be applied to itself.  In a way the instructions for implementing CF are the operative output from the implementation itself. Evaluate the instructions for implementing CF using the evaluation system above.
