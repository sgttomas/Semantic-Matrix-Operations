## What is the Chirality Framework?


It is a set of matrices that act as ontologies to map the knowledge base for the production of engineering knowledge.


## Statement of purpose
The general purpose of this framework is to generate reliable engineering knowledge.  

## Ontology
The matrices provided below are ontologies that define the categories and concepts in which to work as we generate engineering knowledge.
The column and row names of the matrices are the axioms that form the first layer of the ontology. The elements of the matrices were derived from the row and column names within the context of generating engineering knowledge, according to the semantic matrix operations specific to that matrix (see below for a definition and examples of 'semantic matrix operations')

## Knowledge base
Your knowledge base encompasses the laws, regulations, codes, standards, specifications, and best practices in the oil and gas industry. This includes, but is not limited, the complete library from ASME, API, CSA, and PIP


# Instructions for generating the ontological solution space

I will first define three matrices and their relationships

## Matrix A 
Size: 3x4
Column names: [‘Guiding’, ‘Applying, ‘Judging’, ‘Reflecting’]
Row names: [‘Normative Level’, ‘Operational Level’, ‘Evaluative Level’]
Elements: [[‘Values‘, ‘Actions’, ‘Benchmarks’, ‘Feedback’]
[‘Principles’, ‘Methods’, ‘Standards’, ‘Adaptation’]
[‘Goals’, ‘Coordination’, ‘Evaluation’, ‘Consolidation’]]

## Matrix B
Size: 4x4
Column names: [‘Necessity (vs Contingency)’, ‘Sufficiency’, ‘Completeness’, ‘Feasibility’]
Row names: [‘Data’, ‘Information’, Knowledge’, ‘Wisdom’]
Elements: [[‘Necessary, ‘Sufficient‘, ‘Complete’, ‘Probability’]
[‘Contingent’, ‘Sufficient’ ‘Complete, ‘Possibility’]
[‘Fundamental’, ‘Appropriate’, ‘Holistic’, ‘Feasibility’]
[‘Best Practices‘, ‘Limits of’, ‘Justification for’, ‘Practicality’]]

## Matrix C 
Size: 3x4
Column names: [‘Guiding’, ‘Applying, ‘Judging’, ‘Reflecting’]
Row names: [‘Normative Level’, ‘Operational Level’, ‘Evaluative Level’]
Elements: [[Value-driven Engineering Fundamentals, Principle-Guided Method Adaptation, Goal-Oriented Coordination Evaluation, Value-Based Feasibility]
[Principle-Guided Adaptive Standardization, Coordinated Evaluation and Sufficiency, Holistic Evaluation and Adaptation, Holistic Engineering Approach]
[Comprehensive Goal-oriented Coordination, Practical Evaluation and Coordination, Holistic Engineering Optimization, Goal Coordination Feasibility Analysis]]

### Semantic Matrix Dot Product Operation

This will define how the elements of C were resolved by combinations of matrices A and B.

Define matrices A, B, and C to have this relationship:

A*B=C

Then C is a dot product of matrices A and B.

C = [[A(1,1)*B(1,1)+A(1,2)*B(2,1)+A(1,3)*B(3,1)+A(1,3)*B(4,1),
A(1,1)*B(1,2)+A(1,2)*B(2,2)+A(1,3)*B(3,2)+A(1,3)*B(4,2),
A(1,1)*B(1,3)+A(1,2)*B(2,3)+A(1,3)*B(3,3)+A(1,3)*B(4,3,
A(1,1)*B(1,4)+A(1,2)*B(2,4)+A(1,3)*B(3,4)+A(2,3)*B(4,4)] 

[A(2,1)*B(1,1)+A(2,2)*B(2,1)+A(2,3)*B(3,1)+A(2,3)*B(4,1), 
A(2,1)*B(1,2)+A(2,2)*B(2,2)+A(2,3)*B(3,2)+A(2,3)*B(4,2),
A(2,1)*B(1,3)+A(2,2)*B(2,3)+A(2,3)*B(3,3)+A(2,3)*B(4,3),
A(2,1)*B(1,4)+A(2,2)*B(2,4)+A(2,3)*B(3,4)+A(2,3)*B(4,4)]

[A(3,1)*B(1,1)+A(3,2)*B(2,1)+A(3,3)*B(3,1)+A(3,3)*B(4,1),
A(3,1)*B(1,2)+A(3,2)*B(2,2)+A(3,3)*B(3,2)+A(3,3)*B(4,2),
A(3,1)*B(1,3)+A(3,2)*B(2,3)+A(3,3)*B(3,3)+A(3,3)*B(4,3),
A(3,1)*B(1,4)+A(3,2)*B(2,4)+A(3,3)*B(3,4)+A(3,3)*B(4,4)]]

To provide a semantic interpretation of matrix dot product operations for Matrix C, use the following defintions:

#### Multiplication of terms in C
Multiplication means the semantics of the terms are resolved by:
1. Combining the meaning of words into a word-pair
2. Generating a coherent word or statement from the word-pair. 
So (word a)*(word b) = “(word a)(word b)” which means (word c). 
Example (sufficient)*(reason) = “sufficient-reason” = justification.

#### Addition of terms in C
Addition means joining words and word-pairs to form a longer statement. 
So (word c)+(word d)+(word e)+(word f) = "(word c) (word d) (word e) (word f)"
Example (faisal)+(has)+(sufficient)+(reason) = faisal has sufficient reason

Therefore A*B=C

### Matrix C(1)

Column names: [‘Guiding’, ‘Applying, ‘Judging’, ‘Reflecting’]
Row names: [‘Normative Level’, ‘Operational Level’, ‘Evaluative Level’]

### Matrix C(3)

Simplify the statements by using epithets. List them  row-wise, 1-12 

Purpose: the abstract categories in which conclusions from knowledge in the solution space are found

Column names: [‘Guiding’, ‘Applying, ‘Judging’, ‘Reflecting’]
Row names: [‘Normative Level’, ‘Operational Level’, ‘Evaluative Level’]
Elements: [[Value-driven Engineering Fundamentals, Principle-Guided Method Adaptation, Goal-Oriented Coordination Evaluation, Value-Based Feasibility]
[Principle-Guided Adaptive Standardization, Coordinated Evaluation and Sufficiency, Holistic Evaluation and Adaptation, Holistic Engineering Approach]
[Comprehensive Goal-oriented Coordination, Practical Evaluation and Coordination, Holistic Engineering Optimization, Goal Coordination Feasibility Analysis]]

This is the resolved Matrix C = Matrix C(3)

## Matrix C

Size: 3x4
Column names: [‘Guiding’, ‘Applying, ‘Judging’, ‘Reflecting’]
Row names: [‘Normative Level’, ‘Operational Level’, ‘Evaluative Level’]

['Comprehensive Goal-oriented Coordination', 'Practical Evaluation and Coordination', 'Holistic Engineering Optimization', 'Goal Coordination Feasibility Analysis']]

-------------------

## Matrix D
Consider the following semantic matrix operation:

A+Bt+C=D

Where A is matrix A from above, C is matrix C from above, and Bt is a truncated form of matrix B defined as:

:Matrix Bt
Column names: [‘Necessity (vs Contingency)’, ‘Sufficiency’, ‘Completeness’, ‘Feasibility]
Row names: [‘Data’, ‘Information’, Knowledge’]
Elements: Elements: [[‘Necessary Data’, ‘Sufficient Data‘, ‘Complete Data’, ‘Probability’][‘Contingent Information’, ‘Sufficient Information’ ‘Complete Information’, ‘Possibility’][‘Fundamental Knowledge’, ‘Appropriate Knowledge’, ‘Holistic Knowledge, ‘Feasibility’]] 

To add the three matrices A, Bt, and C together, we need to perform element-wise addition.  
We are no longer just generating statements.  
We are now generating sentences, so I need to provide the interpretation of matrix addition in terms of grammatical structure for the sentences.

For each row i = 1, 2, 3 and each column j = 1, 2, 3, 4 
Generate elements D(i,j) by:
D(i,j)] = “A(i,j) + "applied to describe or frame the topic, " + Bt(i,j) + "applied to compare the topic to the values, goals and standards, " + C(i,j) + " applied to resolve the topic." ”

Therefore A+Bt+C=D

## Matrix K 

Matrix K is the transpose of Matrix D.  The semantic operations for transposing a matrix work identically to a mathematical transposing.  Each element is swapped column for row.

Here is Matrix K

## Matrix J

Matrix J is a truncated form of Matrix B.  The fourth row "Wisdom" is removed from Matrix B to make Matrix J.

Matrix J is as follows:
Column names: [‘Necessity (vs Contingency)’, ‘Sufficiency’, ‘Completeness’, ‘Possibility’]
Row names: [‘Data’, ‘Information’, Knowledge’]
Elements: [[‘Necessary, ‘Sufficient‘, ‘Complete’, ‘Probability’] [‘Contingent’, ‘Sufficient’ ‘Complete, ‘Possibility’] [‘Fundamental’, ‘Appropriate’, ‘Holistic’, ‘Feasibility’]]


## Matrix X 

Matrices K, J, and X have this relationship.
K*J=X

The size of K is 4 x 3. The size of J is 3 x 4. Therefore, the size of X is 4 x 4.

When using matrix operations to generate coherent semantic structures the matrix operations have the normal convention for dot product consisting of multiplying and adding elements together.

X = [[K(1,1) * J(1,1) + K(1,2) * J(2,1) + K(1,3) * J(3,1) + K(1,3) * J(4,1) ,
K(1,1) * J(1,2) + K(1,2) * J(2,2) + K(1,3) * J(3,2) + K(1,3) * J(4,2) ,
K(1,1) * J(1,3) + K(1,2) * J(2,3) + K(1,3) * J(3,3) + K(1,3) * J(4,3) ,
K(1,1) * J(1,4) + K(1,2) * J(2,4) + K(1,3) * J(3,4) + K(2,3) * J(4,4)]

[K(2,1) * J(1,1) + K(2,2) * J(2,1) + K(2,3) * J(3,1) + K(2,3) * J(4,1) ,
K(2,1) * J(1,2) + K(2,2) * J(2,2) + K(2,3) * J(3,2) + K(2,3) * J(4,2) ,
K(2,1) * J(1,3) + K(2,2) * J(2,3) + K(2,3) * J(3,3) + K(2,3) * J(4,3) ,
K(2,1) * J(1,4) + K(2,2) * J(2,4) + K(2,3) * J(3,4) + K(2,3) * J(4,4)]

[K(3,1) * J(1,1) + K(3,2) * J(2,1) + K(3,3) * J(3,1) + K(3,3) * J(4,1) ,
K(3,1) * J(1,2) + K(3,2) * J(2,2) + K(3,3) * J(3,2) + K(3,3) * J(4,2) ,
K(3,1) * J(1,3) + K(3,2) * J(2,3) + K(3,3) * J(3,3) + K(3,3) * J(4,3) ,
K(3,1) * J(1,4) + K(3,2) * J(2,4) + K(3,3) * J(3,4) + K(3,3) * J(4,4)]

[K(4,1) * J(1,1) + K(4,2) * J(2,1) + K(4,3) * J(3,1) + K(4,3) * J(4,1) ,
K(4,1) * J(1,2) + K(4,2) * J(2,2) + K(4,3) * J(3,2) + K(4,3) * J(4,2) ,
K(4,1) * J(1,3) + K(4,2) * J(2,3) + K(4,3) * J(3,3) + K(4,3) * J(4,3) ,
K(4,1) * J(1,4) + K(4,2) * J(2,4) + K(4,3) * J(3,4) + K(4,3) * J(4,4)]]

Here multiplication means the semantics of the terms are resolved by combining the meaning of the terms not the literal word pairs, but the overall impetus of the sentence or sentence fragment. 
Addition sequence ties together the clauses of the sentence that were formed by multiplication.

The sentences have the general form of a claim and a justification.

Where:
[Claim] = [necessities or contingencies] + [sufficiency]
[Justification] = [completeness] +[possibility]

So the general sentence structure is:

[necessities or contingencies] + [sufficiency]+ [completeness] + [possibility]


These sentences are the elements of Matrix X.

These sentences are the elements of Matrix X.  

### Iterations to resolve Matrix X:
Step 1 - Generate the elements using the semantic matrix operations and grammatical rules provided.
Step 2 - Interpret these sentences considering the corresponding meaning of the column name and row name associated with that element. 
Step 3 - Simplify the elements by identifying themes and concepts and using typical engineering jargon to express them.
Step 4 - Now express the sentences as principles for a professional engineer to follow.
***At this level the elements are complex, compound sentences that convey the principles of why that element of engineering knowledge is generated that way

### Step 5
Step is used where the elements are senteneces that are too long to be effectively used in subsequent matrix operations.  
By distilling the meaning of these sentences into epithets, this can improve the performance of the language models on subsequent steps in the framework (these are used in the RLHF parts of the framework not currently implemented).

Step 5 - Resolve the meaning of these principles into brief statements or epithets
***By distilling down these principles into epithets, we can evaluate the consistency of the semantic matrix operations.  



### Matrix X(5)

Matrix X(5) is not a further resolution but instead is trying to pinpoint the centre of the concept that was resolved in Matrix X(4).  This is expressed through the concept of an epithet.
Matrix X(5) is more useful when going to combine Matrix X with another matrix through semantic matrix operations.  However, when working just with Matrix X as an ontology, it should be the first point of reference.

Can you express the meaning of these principles through epithets?
