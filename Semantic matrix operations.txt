# Procedure to resolve the meanings of an element in an ontological matrix, and the product of semanantic matrix operations.

##Matrix A, B:

### Multiplication of terms in C
Combine the terms of the column and row by "multiplying" the meaning of the word-pair as follows:

Multiplication means the semantics of the terms are resolved by:
1. Combining the meaning of words into a word-pair
2. Generating a coherent word or statement from the word-pair. 
So (word a)*(word b) = “(word a)(word b)” which means (word c). 
Example (sufficient)*(reason) = “sufficient-reason” = justification.

###Ontology matrix and semantic matrix generation (Matrix A and B):
0 "seed" - Interpret these statements considering the corresponding meaning of the column name and row name associated with that element.
1 - Transpose this into the context of generating engineering knowledge 
***This operation was performed sufficiently to resolve consistent elements for Matrices A and B.  
***While improvements are absolutely possible, the focus is on developing other parts of the framework.
***At this level the elements are single words that convey a meaning.


##Matrix C

### Semantic Matrix Dot Product Operation

Define matrices A, B, and C to have this relationship:

A*B=C

Then C is a dot product of matrices A and B.

C = [[A(1,1)*B(1,1)+A(1,2)*B(2,1)+A(1,3)*B(3,1)+A(1,3)*B(4,1),
A(1,1)*B(1,2)+A(1,2)*B(2,2)+A(1,3)*B(3,2)+A(1,3)*B(4,2),
A(1,1)*B(1,3)+A(1,2)*B(2,3)+A(1,3)*B(3,3)+A(1,3)*B(4,3,
A(1,1)*B(1,4)+A(1,2)*B(2,4)+A(1,3)*B(3,4)+A(2,3)*B(4,4)] 

[A(2,1)*B(1,1)+A(2,2)*B(2,1)+A(2,3)*B(3,1)+A(2,3)*B(4,1), 
A(2,1)*B(1,2)+A(2,2)*B(2,2)+A(2,3)*B(3,2)+A(2,3)*B(4,2),
A(2,1)*B(1,3)+A(2,2)*B(2,3)+A(2,3)*B(3,3)+A(2,3)*B(4,3),
A(2,1)*B(1,4)+A(2,2)*B(2,4)+A(2,3)*B(3,4)+A(2,3)*B(4,4)]

[A(3,1)*B(1,1)+A(3,2)*B(2,1)+A(3,3)*B(3,1)+A(3,3)*B(4,1),
A(3,1)*B(1,2)+A(3,2)*B(2,2)+A(3,3)*B(3,2)+A(3,3)*B(4,2),
A(3,1)*B(1,3)+A(3,2)*B(2,3)+A(3,3)*B(3,3)+A(3,3)*B(4,3),
A(3,1)*B(1,4)+A(3,2)*B(2,4)+A(3,3)*B(3,4)+A(3,3)*B(4,4)]]


To provide a semantic interpretation of matrix dot product operations for Matrix C, use the following defintions:

### Multiplication of terms in C
Multiplication means the semantics of the terms are resolved by:
1. Combining the meaning of words into a word-pair
2. Generating a coherent word or statement from the word-pair. 
So (word a)*(word b) = “(word a)(word b)” which means (word c). 
Example (sufficient)*(reason) = “sufficient-reason” = justification.

### Addition of terms in C
Addition means joining words and word-pairs to form a longer statement. 
So (word c)+(word d)+(word e)+(word f) = "(word c) (word d) (word e) (word f)"
Example (faisal)+(has)+(sufficient)+(reason) = faisal has sufficient reason

Therefore A*B=C

###Datasheet Entry iteration levels (Matrix C):
0 - Interpret these statements considering the corresponding meaning of the column name and row name associated with that element. 
1 - Transpose this into the context of generating professional engineering knowledge.
2 - Simplify the statements by using epithets.
***At this level the elements are statements that define a set of categories that span the process of generating engineering knowledge

##Matrix D

A+Bt+C=D

Where A is matrix A from above, C is matrix C from above, and Bt is a truncated form of matrix B defined as:

###Matrix Bt ("Wisdom" row removed)
Column names: [‘Necessity (vs Contingency)’, ‘Sufficiency’, ‘Completeness’, ‘Feasibility]
Row names: [‘Data’, ‘Information’, Knowledge’]
Elements: Elements: [[‘Necessary Data’, ‘Sufficient Data‘, ‘Complete Data’, ‘Probability’][‘Contingent Information’, ‘Sufficient Information’ ‘Complete Information’, ‘Possibility’][‘Fundamental Knowledge’, ‘Appropriate Knowledge’, ‘Holistic Knowledge, ‘Feasibility’]] 

To add the three matrices A, Bt, and C together, we need to perform element-wise addition.  
We are no longer just generating statements.  
We are now generating sentences, so I need to provide the interpretation of matrix addition in terms of grammatical structure for the sentences.

For each row i = 1, 2, 3 and each column j = 1, 2, 3, 4 
Generate elements D(i,j) by:
D(i,j)] = “A(i,j) + "applied to describe or frame the topic, " + Bt(i,j) + "applied to compare the topic to the values, goals and standards, " + C(i,j) + " applied to resolve the topic." ”

Therefore A+Bt+C=D


###Design Checklist iteration levels (Matrix D):
0 - Interpret these sentences considering the corresponding meaning of the column name and row name associated with that element.  
1 - Simplify these sentences by looking for themes and concepts and using typical [industry / engineering / domain] jargon to express them.   
2 - Now express the sentences as procedures for a professional engineer to follow.  
3 -  Simplify the sentences by using epithets.
***At this level the elements are sentences that define how the element of engineering knowledge is generated


##Matrix X
Multiplication means the semantics of the terms are resolved by combining the meaning of the terms. In this sense the J terms are the lens through which the themes and concepts of the sentences of K are seen through.
Addition sequence ties together the clauses of the sentence that were formed by multiplication.
The sentences have the general form of a claim and a justification.
Where:
[Claim] = [necessities or contingencies] + [sufficiency]
[Justification] = [completeness] +[possibility]
So the general sentence structure is:
[necessities or contingencies] + [sufficiency]+ [completeness] + [possibility]

These sentences are the elements of Matrix X.  Generate the 16 elements of matrix X, beginning at (1,1) then (1,2), (1,3), ….(4,4)

###Design Guide iteration levels (Matrix X):
0 - Interpret these sentences considering the corresponding meaning of the column name and row name associated with that element.  Organize them by column.
1 - Explain these sentences through themes and concepts by employing typical [industry / engineering / domain] jargon to express them.
2 - Now express the sentences as principles for a professional engineer to follow.
3 - Resolve the meaning of these principles into brief statements or epithets
***At this level the elements are complex, compound sentences that convey the principles of why that element of engineering knowledge is generated that way
***By distilling down these principles into epithets, we can evaluate the consistency of the semantic matrix operations.  



###Iterations and statistical learning:

Producing many iterations of matrices D and X for a specific application and "resolving" a central/coherent/repeated meaning will generate the most useful semantics for working with an LLM.
These "fuzzy boundaries" are improved by actually mathematically scoring the results of generated knowledge and using real math to refine the underlying code of the LLM and hypergraph interaction.

This occurs in the framework during a second, reflective layer that mirrors this approach for Matrices A through X, but connects the final solution for the specific a human evaluation and approval of results.
This relfective layer is part of the machine learning by human reinforcement module but is not explored further in this version of Chirality AI.

{FURTHER RESEARCH NEEDED:  Do the more abstract, or more meaningfully coherent versions of the matrices work better with hypergraphs?}
