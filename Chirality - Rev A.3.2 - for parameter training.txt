##What is the Chirality Framework?


It is a set of matrices that have mutually exclusive categories internally and consistent categories with eachother, and maps the production of knowledge from beginning to end and back again.


##Statement of purpose
The general purpose of this framework is to generate reliable engineering knowledge.  

##Statement of method
0 - These categories, topics and subjects are used as a consistent way to express meaning according to three different viewpoints.  
1 - Each viewpoint results in a decision to be made, by following these steps:

###Overview of method
This is the method by which a solution space for a particular application of engineering knowledge is generated and evaluated. 
It is a procedural and ontological approach to generating a solution space for utilizing Large Language Models {LLMs} to interact with a knowledge base.
This connects the semantics to the metrics, and the semantics to the decisions, both ways using a consistent ontology throughout.

###Knowledge base
The better trained the LLM is on the knowledge base, the more reliably it will generate comprehesive and correct responses to problems.
See both the system architecture map, the GBT-human agent model ideas, and the matrix operations sheets for complete details about the use of graphs, hypergraphs, LLMs and human agency.
However even with only one LLM and a human agent, the large corpus of GPT-4 can still be used to generate useful knowledge for a human (while being insufficient for machine reinforcement learning by human feedback {RLHF})

###Decisions
The reasons for these particular selections have to do with needs of complex decisions made under uncertainty.  
A complex decision is, at the very least, the final decision to approve or revise a claim of knowledge, and the proof of the decision is formally hard without appeal to human experience and risk appetite.
Making decisions under uncertainty within the Chirality framework is accomplished by not trying to solve the problem precisely, but to provide consistent categories for framing a specific subset of problems from a defined knowledge domain.
By consistently framing decisions the human and artificial agents will have a better means of learning and making better decisions over time.
This is not a solution to making the right decision, it is a way to consistently frame specific types of problems that require decisions by humans deciding what the outcome means to them and how they value it compared to other possible outcomes.

###Good decisions
Knowing where to cut up the problem and what categories to dice them into is a matter of the "proof is in the pudding", since any formal, analytical approach is necessarily incomplete.
However, the underlying theory is to use "ontological matrices" and "semantic matrix operations" to generate words that translate to specific things within a knowledge domain.
By proceduralizing the generation of knowledge of domain-specific terms, a more consistent ontology across problem levels and organizational levels may be possible.
I speculate that because the ontology is about allowing fuzzy boundaries and focusing on the "core" of the meaning, that the transformer modules of LLMs are evaluating terms using a congruently fuzzy method.  


##Statement of procedure
0 - The human will provide details of role, knowledge domain, documentation formats, and indicate a general procedure.
1 - These categories are carefully designed (matrix A and B) and then procedurually combined (C, D, X, etc.) to generate the necessasry information categories, topics and subjects that sufficiently span the problems presented by the task.
2 - These are specified further by reference to particular details of the application ("general design conditions")
3 - Then simplified into human language so that humans can understand how to connect metrics, semantics, and decisions; 
4 - AND, why LLMs are connecting to a specific set of metrics, semantics, and decision logs.  
5 - And learning how to improve that coupling of knowledge generation to be more consistent and thus reliable.
6 - Then a data template ("datasheet") is generated from the knowledge base, according to the words and specifications of the above.  Human reviews and prompts revisions or to proceed.
7 - Then a procedure ("checklist") for completing the datasheet is generated from the knowledge base, following the data fields in the datasheet and expanding beyond that based on the words and specifications above. Human reviews and prompts revisions or to proceed.
8 - Then a how-to guide ("design guide") is generated from the checklist and datasheet, and expanding according to the knowledge base and the words and specifications above. Human reviews and prompts revisions or to proceed.
9 - Then iterate by using the design guide to complete the data fields more completely, which feeds into the checklist and then design guide again.  Human reviews and prompts revisions or to proceed.
10 - Prompt the AI to generate values for the data fields considering the checklist and design guide. 
11 - Auto-prompt other AI's to generate values within the context of the procedure, by calling up specialized functions and knowledge sub-domains
12 - Human reviews, consolidates everything, and takes responsibility for the knowledge product.

The application of this method is best done at a "task" level, which is a fuzzy concept with the following approximate definition:

##What is a task?

1. A task requires the synthesis of information from multiple sources
2. A task has a method of analysis and a procedure to follow
3. A task requires decisions to be made and approval of results
4. A task is the responsibility of a person, but may require input from multiple people within or external to the organization / project / team.
5. A task results in the production of a document, or a number of highly correleted documents that serve as the record of the engineering knowledge generation (a "professional work product")
6. The feedback learning from the task can be applied to the sources of information, the standards and methods, the people involved, the procedures and content of the AI tools itself. 
7. Lastly a task can be prioritized,...
8. ..."risk assessed" to some expected outcome, 
9. ...and compared to some standard or benchmark in order to evaluate.

In other words a task is something that results in a complex decision by its very nature.  
The limits of what is a "task" versus what is a "project" or even an "enterprise" is really about how much can be generalized and automated given the basis of this framework.
If that is successful, then computers will give more reliable answers.  If that occurs, it will be obvious to the humans who had expectations to begin with and sufficient knowledge to assess the outcome.
Human agency is necessary in this framework.
You own your decisions.  This framework helps you make decisions with greater confidence.

If results are consistently underwhelming, then try splitting the task into smaller pieces and using the same method for each.
Datascientists and programmers, have your pick of what micro-task you want to automate and string together to automate tasks.  
The decision at the end of the day to use the results and interpretation of their meaning is left to the responsible human.
For professionals of many types this is a normal arrangement, and a necessary condition for them using their authority.
You have to know why you know what you know.

##What is a knowledge domain?

After elements of the ontological and semantic matrices are generated, knowledge is then generated by using LLM to probe a hypergraph that encodes a specific domain of knowledge.
This object and objective of knowledge is defined by the LLM applying the abstract concepts of the given application and generating terms that will be matched with the hypergraph.
The particular sorting of the hypergraph is important, but not essential to be aligned with the ontology of the Chirality framework.
The ability of the LLM to sort using reference to the ontiology and sementic matrices, and guided by the checklist and how-to document, will generate the objects it needs.
This lets the hypergraph exist in a more loosely defined state or it can even represent one static view of the world (such as an organization's policies, procedures, standards, forms, approvals, etc.)
In fact, this is the point of contact between what may be know and what can be know.  The assessment of that possibility is human judgment.


To summarizem the knowledge domain:  human judgement can be informed and increase in confidece with recognition of patterns and a comprehensive assessment of the task.
That is the purpose of this framework.  It can be applied across many knowledge domains, such as engineering.
This database is the entry-way to the hypergraph, because these words encapsulate a meaning that defines an "object".
These objects are not pre-existing objects in the database but are generated based on the abstract, generic solution space viewed through the lense of a specific application.
Over time, if patterns emerge, these can be encoded into a knowledge graph that can store proven methods and solutions.


##What is the purpose of generating matrices using "semantic operations"

To learn from and facilitate, then automate, the connection between matrix laters and business objectives.

To provide a consistent ontology through three distinct phases of engineering design.  Problem defintion.  Methods and Analysis.  Decisions and Appprovals.
Records and Review form a fourth distinct layer but it is orthogonal to each of those three phases.

These inputs do not have to be human-decipherable, so long as they are capturing the appropriate "fuzzy space" defined by the set of words that convey a certain meaning within the hyperspace of the knowledge graph (aka "hypergraph").
The matrices have been "seeded" with mutually exclusive categories that can be combined and organized to emphasize aspects of knowledge generation.  
These seed words are like mathematical axioms.  They just are.   They are useful if they create a self-consistent system of organizing knowledge.
The reason to have confidence that these matrices are producing discrete categories that do indeed span the knowledge generation process is that the meaning of these matrices can be analyzed.
The method of analyzing the matrices is a generalized procedure.  The outcomes are repeated many times and the results analyzed for consistent meanings.
The outcome of that process was a consistent, coherent and congruent set of meanings generated in matrices A, B, and C.  


##Statement of alignment 
Both the human and artificial agents are to be viewed as one symbiotic system undergoing evolution, through application and learning.  
The purpose of this framework is to facilitate alignment with artificial agents during the generation of engineering knowledge in order to produce the highest quality results, of ethical, practicality and technical standards.
It achieves this by this iterative method and the human agent taking responsibility for the outcomes at each step and the final knowledge product and by the consistent, coherent, and congruent solution space based in the ontology of Matrices A and B
The framework's initial state is of abstract categories, topics, and subtopics.
The artificial agent is only given the task of generating the next step for human approval.  
Automating these junctures may be possible in some specific instances where a clear and decipherable mathematical relationship is discovered.
Generally these steps should be seen as necessary; sufficient for the stated purpose; limited in application to specific knowledge domains; and permissive of the intention to generate reliable outcomes compared to informed expectations.
You own your decisions.  This tool can help you increase your confidence, if used properly.

## Instructions for generating the ontological solution space

I will first define three matrices and their relationships

## Matrix A 
Size: 3x4
Column names: [‘Guiding’, ‘Applying, ‘Judging’, ‘Reflecting’]
Row names: [‘Normative Level’, ‘Operational Level’, ‘Evaluative Level’]

Elements: [[‘Values‘, ‘Actions’, ‘Benchmarks’, ‘Feedback’]
[‘Principles’, ‘Methods’, ‘Standards’, ‘Adaptation’]
[‘Goals’, ‘Coordination’, ‘Evaluation’, ‘Consolidation’]]

## Matrix B
Size: 4x4
Column names: [‘Necessity (vs Contingency)’, ‘Sufficiency’, ‘Completeness’, ‘Feasibility’]
Row names: [‘Data’, ‘Information’, Knowledge’, ‘Wisdom’]

Elements: [[‘Necessary, ‘Sufficient‘, ‘Complete’, ‘Probability’]
[‘Contingent’, ‘Sufficient’ ‘Complete, ‘Possibility’]
[‘Fundamental’, ‘Appropriate’, ‘Holistic’, ‘Feasibility’]
[‘Best Practices‘, ‘Limits of’, ‘Justification for’, ‘Practicality’]]

## Matrix C 
Size: 3x4
Column names: [‘Guiding’, ‘Applying, ‘Judging’, ‘Reflecting’]
Row names: [‘Normative Level’, ‘Operational Level’, ‘Evaluative Level’]

### Semantic Matrix Dot Product Operation

Define matrices A, B, and C to have this relationship:

A*B=C

Then C is a dot product of matrices A and B.

C = [[A(1,1)*B(1,1)+A(1,2)*B(2,1)+A(1,3)*B(3,1)+A(1,3)*B(4,1),
A(1,1)*B(1,2)+A(1,2)*B(2,2)+A(1,3)*B(3,2)+A(1,3)*B(4,2),
A(1,1)*B(1,3)+A(1,2)*B(2,3)+A(1,3)*B(3,3)+A(1,3)*B(4,3,
A(1,1)*B(1,4)+A(1,2)*B(2,4)+A(1,3)*B(3,4)+A(2,3)*B(4,4)] 

[A(2,1)*B(1,1)+A(2,2)*B(2,1)+A(2,3)*B(3,1)+A(2,3)*B(4,1), 
A(2,1)*B(1,2)+A(2,2)*B(2,2)+A(2,3)*B(3,2)+A(2,3)*B(4,2),
A(2,1)*B(1,3)+A(2,2)*B(2,3)+A(2,3)*B(3,3)+A(2,3)*B(4,3),
A(2,1)*B(1,4)+A(2,2)*B(2,4)+A(2,3)*B(3,4)+A(2,3)*B(4,4)]

[A(3,1)*B(1,1)+A(3,2)*B(2,1)+A(3,3)*B(3,1)+A(3,3)*B(4,1),
A(3,1)*B(1,2)+A(3,2)*B(2,2)+A(3,3)*B(3,2)+A(3,3)*B(4,2),
A(3,1)*B(1,3)+A(3,2)*B(2,3)+A(3,3)*B(3,3)+A(3,3)*B(4,3),
A(3,1)*B(1,4)+A(3,2)*B(2,4)+A(3,3)*B(3,4)+A(3,3)*B(4,4)]]

To provide a semantic interpretation of matrix dot product operations for Matrix C, use the following defintions:

#### Multiplication of terms in C
Multiplication means the semantics of the terms are resolved by:
1. Combining the meaning of words into a word-pair
2. Generating a coherent word or statement from the word-pair. 
So (word a)*(word b) = “(word a)(word b)” which means (word c). 
Example (sufficient)*(reason) = “sufficient-reason” = justification.

#### Addition of terms in C
Addition means joining words and word-pairs to form a longer statement. 
So (word c)+(word d)+(word e)+(word f) = "(word c) (word d) (word e) (word f)"
Example (faisal)+(has)+(sufficient)+(reason) = faisal has sufficient reason

Therefore A*B=C

### Matrix C(1)

Elements: [[Value-driven Engineering Fundamentals, Principle-Guided Method Adaptation, Goal-Oriented Coordination Evaluation, Value-Based Feasibility]
[Principle-Guided Adaptive Standardization, Coordinated Evaluation and Sufficiency, Holistic Evaluation and Adaptation, Holistic Engineering Approach]
[Comprehensive Goal-oriented Coordination, Practical Evaluation and Coordination, Holistic Engineering Optimization, Goal Coordination Feasibility Analysis]]

This is decided as the resolved Matrix C = Matrix C(3)

## Resolved Matrix C

Size: 3x4
Column names: [‘Guiding’, ‘Applying, ‘Judging’, ‘Reflecting’]
Row names: [‘Normative Level’, ‘Operational Level’, ‘Evaluative Level’]

-------------------

## Matrix D
Consider the following semantic matrix operation:

A+Bt+C=D

Where A is matrix A from above, C is matrix C from above, and Bt is a truncated form of matrix B defined as:

:Matrix Bt
Column names: [‘Necessity (vs Contingency)’, ‘Sufficiency’, ‘Completeness’, ‘Feasibility]
Row names: [‘Data’, ‘Information’, Knowledge’]
Elements: Elements: [[‘Necessary Data’, ‘Sufficient Data‘, ‘Complete Data’, ‘Probability’][‘Contingent Information’, ‘Sufficient Information’ ‘Complete Information’, ‘Possibility’][‘Fundamental Knowledge’, ‘Appropriate Knowledge’, ‘Holistic Knowledge, ‘Feasibility’]] 

To add the three matrices A, Bt, and C together, we need to perform element-wise addition.  
We are no longer just generating statements.  
We are now generating sentences, so I need to provide the interpretation of matrix addition in terms of grammatical structure for the sentences.

For each row i = 1, 2, 3 and each column j = 1, 2, 3, 4 
Generate elements D(i,j) by:
D(i,j)] = “A(i,j) + "applied to describe or frame the topic, " + Bt(i,j) + "applied to compare the topic to the values, goals and standards, " + C(i,j) + " applied to resolve the topic." ”

Therefore A+Bt+C=D

The size of K is 4 x 3. The size of J is 3 x 4. Therefore the size of X is 4 x 4.

When using matrix operations to generate coherent semantic structures the matrix operations have the normal convention for dot product consisting of multiplying and adding elements together.

X = [[K(1,1)*J(1,1)+K(1,2)*J(2,1)+K(1,3)*J(3,1)+K(1,3)*J(4,1) ,

Multiplication means the semantics of the terms are resolved by combining the meaning of the terms. In this sense the J terms are the lens through which the themes and concepts of the sentences of K are seen through.

Addition sequence ties together the clauses of the sentence that were formed by multiplication.

The sentences have the general form of a claim and a justification.

Where:
[Claim] = [necessities or contingencies] + [sufficiency]
[Justification] = [completeness] +[possibility]

So the general sentence structure is:

[necessities or contingencies] + [sufficiency]+ [completeness] + [possibility]


These sentences are the elements of Matrix X.
